# Kurant-app
## Under construction

An application where you can keep track of the expenses (an expense is made when a member is late, lost a bet or some rule is broken) of two different teams. This app is tailored to fit the needs of a specific person/position during the reception of new students at KTH, so the application and user scenario wouldn't make much sense to anyone outside the management team of the reception. (and therefore has a very specific target group)

I decided to make this after I, last year, realized that I hate using excel on my phone with a burning passion. This app does not replace excel sheet by any means, but based on how I used it (to keep track of the expenses for the two different teams.) this application could (hopefully) be a good replacement. And I also needed a new project, and this seemd to be reasonably challengeing as it has multiple features and I build my own REST API, which include user authentication.
