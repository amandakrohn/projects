## Web scraper
Web scraper that (is supposed to) scrapes different swedish news websites. It has absolutely zero error handling - however it will be prioritized when the basic structure is finished. 

Currently only scrapes one website when the program is executed and prints the biggest news article teaser. 

My ambition is to add more news websites and have the program update twice every day. I would also like to make an interface (like a website or similar) where the news are displayed, and where you can find old (up to 7 days) articles.

### How to use it
It is built using python and has the following dependencies:
- requests
- beautifulSoup4
  
The dependencies can be installed using pip
To install requests: 
`pip install requests`

To install BeautifulSoup4:
`pip install bs4`
